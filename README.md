        <h2>Departmental Activities</h2>
        <p>The department of EVS/EHS conducts various activities throughout the academic session in order to keep its student body engaged. The activities vary in nature, some of them include academic activities which help the student express themselves while others include social activities in accordance with the college’s social responsibility. These activities are explained as follows:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Brand/Waste Audit</h3>
        <p>The department in collaboration with Zero Waste Himalaya conducts an annual Brand/Waste Audit under the aegis of “The Himalayan Cleanup”. The activity sees participating students clean and collect waste from an area which is then segregated based on its type, furthermore details regarding the brand associated with that waste is documented. This activity helps the student learn what constitutes major waste types in an area. The students during the activity are also taught how to audit their own personal household waste so that they may learn to make better decision towards sustainability.</p>
        <p>Below are a few pictures from waste audits conducted by the department.</p>
